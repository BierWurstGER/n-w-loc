	<string key="1403_Topic1_Prompt">Logoramento</string>
	<string key="1403_Topic1_Response">Il logoramento è una maledizione terrestre e, in quanto tale, è anche una maledizione corporale. I demoni di Frutteto dell'Eden ne sono infettati, ma il logoramento colpisce anche il corpo degli umani. Ti indebolisce, facendoti avvicinare alla morte a ogni respiro. Fai attenzione, devi difenderti adeguatamente quando ti trovi nelle aree logorate di Frutteto dell'Eden.</string>
	<string key="1425_Prospector_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Uhm... Cos'è una "Carica all'avamposto"?"</string>
	<string key="1425_Prospector_talk_Response" speaker="ProspectorDelgado" name="ProspectorDelgado" VO="1425_Prospector_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Carica all'avamposto è una partita 20 contro 20 ambientata su una grande isola con tre avamposti.\nI giocatori dovranno conquistare e difendere questi avamposti il più a lungo possibile, aumentando così il punteggio della propria squadra.</string>
	<string key="1427_0101_TalkTo_Cultist01_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">"I am looking for someone, actually."</string>
	<string key="1427_0101_TalkTo_Cultist01_Response" speaker="Cultist Akech - Edengrove" gender="Male" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">Oh? Well, I am afraid I cannot help you there. I arrived only this morning and I do not know a single name!</string>
	<string key="1427_0101_TalkTo_Cultist02_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">"Will any other newcomers be there?"</string>
	<string key="1427_0101_TalkTo_Cultist02_Response" speaker="Cultist Ylva - Edengrove" gender="Female" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">Well… we did have one young woman at our table last night, but I am not certain if she will choose to stay. If you ask me, she seemed rather attached to her mother.</string>
	<string key="1427_0101_TalkTo_Cultist03_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">"Have you met a young woman named Han Liu?"</string>
	<string key="1427_0101_TalkTo_Cultist03_Response" speaker="Cultist Jalair - Edengrovr" gender="Male" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">I have. Is she a friend of yours? You might want to speak to the High Seer if you would like to join her. I believe she departed for her walk in the dark hours of the morning.</string>
	<string key="1427_0101_TalkTo_CultOfficer_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">"I am looking for a woman named Han Liu."</string>
	<string key="1427_0101_TalkTo_CultOfficer_Response" speaker="Agnes Cubert - Edengrove" gender="Female" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">Ah, Miss Liu. A promising young spark, that one. She walks the path of truth now. If she returns, I am sure she will be glad to see you after such a trial. We all eagerly await the outcome of her communion.</string>
	<string key="1427_0102_TalkTo_CultOfficer_Pilgrimmage_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">"I'm ready to learn more."</string>
	<string key="1427_0102_TalkTo_CultOfficer_Pilgrimmage_Response" speaker="Agnes Cubert - Edengrove" gender="Female" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">I can tell you, or you can see for yourself. Follow the path to the south as it mounts the peak. Imbue these seeds in a great temple's waters and plant them in soft soil.\n\nIf you are swift, you may join Miss Liu.</string>
	<string key="1427_0102_TalkTo_Oath_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">&lt;Speak the Oath.&gt;</string>
	<string key="1427_0102_TalkTo_Oath_Response" speaker="Oath Object" gender="None" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">"I stand before my fellows, humbled by nature's majesty.\n\nI came with many questions, and I seek only answers.\n\nI give myself to the unknown, in hopes of renewing my body and soul.\n\nWhat may be, will be."</string>
	<string key="1427_0102_TalkTo_Daughter_Umbrage_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">"I'm not sure I am ready for this. Are you?"</string>
	<string key="1427_0102_TalkTo_Daughter_Umbrage_Response" speaker="Han Liu - Edengrove" gender="Female" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">I think so. I have read everything available to me in the enclave. I have spoken at length to the High Sage. I think I know enough about Umbrage to escape an unpleasant death there.\n\nAll the same… come with me?</string>
	<string key="1427_0104_TalkTo_CultMother_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">"She survived, but she chose to join them."</string>
	<string key="1427_0104_TalkTo_CultMother_Response" speaker="Han Fang - Edengrove" gender="Female" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">It is as I feared.\n\nI have already asked so much of you… but could you stay with her? Convince them you intend to join as well? I cannot imagine leaving her alone with them. Her mind is so… malleable.</string>
	<string key="1427_0109_TalkTo_CultOfficer_Gold_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">"Here is what I collected."</string>
	<string key="1427_0109_TalkTo_CultOfficer_Gold_Response" speaker="High Seer Agnes - Edengrove" gender="Female" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">Thank you. I have asked a great deal of you. It is time now for you to rest.\n\nGo now and meditate on all that you have seen.</string>
	<string key="1430_CultLeader_AboutCult_Prompt" speaker="Player Prompt" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">"Can you tell me more about this cult?"</string>
	<string key="1430_CultLeader_AboutCult_Response" speaker="The High Sage - Edengrove" gender="Male" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">If I were to write a pamphlet, I would wax eloquent about balance, simplicity, a life free from greed.\n\nBut you are here, among us. Stay. Share our meals. Listen to our stories. Our ways are open to any and all.</string>
	<string key="1430_CultLeader_AboutMask_Prompt" speaker="Player Prompt" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">"What's with the mask?"</string>
	<string key="1430_CultLeader_AboutMask_Response" speaker="The High Sage - Edengrove" gender="Male" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">I have a profoundly ugly face.\n\nNo, pardon my jest. I chose this mask to reinforce that I am nothing, indeed I am no ONE, but a conduit for the ethos of the Cult. It matters not who I am, only what I may offer.</string>
	<string key="1430_CultLeader_HighSage_Prompt" speaker="Player Prompt" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">"Are you the High Sage?"</string>
	<string key="1430_CultLeader_HighSage_Response" speaker="The High Sage - Edengrove" gender="Male" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">I am, though it is not a title I would have chosen for myself. I was drawn here, just like the others, but I feel I have come closest to articulating why.\n\nPerhaps that is why they chose me.</string>
	<string key="1431_0103_TalkTo_Innkeeper_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">"Lilian said you could give me a drink…?"</string>
	<string key="1431_0103_TalkTo_Innkeeper_Response" speaker="Innkeeper Yatim- Edengrove" gender="Male" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">I take it they ah… stepped out… as it were. Here, go on, I'll put it on their tab.</string>
	<string key="1434_0104_TalkTo_Dryad_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt" rel_version="Quest_Supplement_Edengrove">"Are you Ranger Yasin's 'Love'?"</string>
	<string key="1434_0104_TalkTo_Dryad_Response" speaker="Dryad Hedera - Edengrove" gender="Female">Potrebbe pensarlo. A volte i miei fiori hanno questo effetto sugli umani. Andrò da lui.\n\nLa cura è cruenta ma efficace. Raccogli del Logoramento e portalo nella mia grotta. Aggiungerò delle indicazioni alla tua mappa.</string>
